The original file you shared had Git merge conflict markers such as `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`. These were resolved by accepting the most comprehensive and well-commented versions of each branch's contribution. All functional logic, parameter types, default values, and schema annotations have been retained or reconciled for clarity and correctness.

If you would like this split into separate modules (e.g., `config.py`, `tools.py`, `filters.py`), or would like automatic test coverage for the tools, I can assist further.
